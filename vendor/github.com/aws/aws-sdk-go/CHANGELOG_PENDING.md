### SDK Bugs
* `private/mode/api`: Fix error code constants being generated incorrectly.([#1958](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/1958))
    * Fixes the SDK's code generation to not modify the error code text value when generating error code constants. This prevents generating error code values which are invalid and will never be sent by the service. This change does not change the error code constant variable name generated by the SDK, only the value of the error code.
    * Fixes [#1856](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/1856)
